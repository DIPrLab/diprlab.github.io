- **Who can attend**: Anyone, inside or outside of PSU, with an interest in the subject matter.

Reading group announcements are sent to [the DBRG mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/pdx.edu/g/database-reading-group). This will include information about the research paper, presenter, and how to access it.
