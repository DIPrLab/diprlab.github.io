Abstract Real-world tasks such as recommending videos tagged kids can be reduced to finding similar vectors associated with hard predicates. This task, filtered vector search, is challenging as prior state-of-the-art graph-based (unfiltered) similarity search techniques degenerate when hard constraints are considered: effective graph-based filtered similarity search relies on sufficient connectivity for reaching similar items within a few hops. To consider predicates, recent works propose modifying graph traversal to visit only items that satisfy predicates. However, they fail to offer the just-a-few-hops property for a wide range of predicates: they must restrict predicates significantly or lose efficiency if only few items satisfy predicates. We propose an opposite approach: instead of constraining traversal, we build many indexes each serving different predicate forms. For effective construction, we devise a three-dimensional analytical model capturing relationships among index size, search time, and recall, with which we follow a workload-aware approach to pack as many useful indexes as possible into a collection. At query time, the analytical model is employed yet again to discern the one that offers the fastest search at a given recall. We show superior performance and support on datasets with varying selectivities and forms: our approach achieves up to 8.06 x speedup while having as low as 1% build time versus other indexes, with less than 2.15 x memory of a standard HNSW graph and modest knowledge of past workloads.

Abstract Social event detection refers to extracting relevant message clusters from social media data streams to represent specific events in the real world. Social event detection is important in numerous areas, such as opinion analysis, social safety, and decision-making. Most current methods are supervised and require access to large amounts of data. These methods need prior knowledge of the events and carry a high risk of leaking sensitive information in the messages, making them less applicable in open-world settings. Therefore, conducting unsupervised detection while fully utilizing the rich information in the messages and protecting data privacy remains a significant challenge. To this end, we propose a novel social event detection framework, ADP-SEMEvent, an unsupervised social event detection method that prioritizes privacy. Specifically, ADP-SEMEvent is divided into two stages, i.e., the construction stage of the private message graph and the clustering stage of the private message graph. In the first stage, an adaptive differential privacy approach is used to construct a private message graph. In this process, our method can adaptively apply differential privacy based on the events occurring each day in an open environment to maximize the use of the privacy budget. In the second stage, to address the reduction in data utility caused by noise, a novel 2-dimensional structural entropy minimization algorithm based on optimal subgraphs is used to detect events in the message graph. The highlight of this process is unsupervised and does not compromise differential privacy. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that ADP-SEMEvent can achieve detection performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining reasonable privacy budget parameters.

Tsay ,Themis Palpanas , Michael J. Franklin Abstract The detection of anomalies in time series has gained ample academic and industrial attention. However, no comprehensive benchmark exists to evaluate time-series anomaly detection methods. It is common to use (i) proprietary or synthetic data, often biased to support particular claims; or (ii) a limited collection of publicly available datasets. Consequently, we often observe methods performing exceptionally well in one dataset but surprisingly poorly in another, creating an illusion of progress. To address the issues above, we thoroughly studied over one hundred papers to identify, collect, process, and systematically format datasets proposed in the past decades. We summarize our effort in TSB-UAD, a new benchmark to ease the evaluation of univariate time-series anomaly detection methods. Overall, TSB-UAD contains 13766 time series with labeled anomalies spanning different domains with high variability of anomaly types, ratios, and sizes. TSB-UAD includes 18 previously proposed datasets containing 1980 time series and we contribute two collections of datasets. Specifically, we generate 958 time series using a principled methodology for transforming 126 time-series classification datasets into time series with labeled anomalies. In addition, we present data transformations with which we introduce new anomalies, resulting in 10828 time series with varying complexity for anomaly detection. Finally, we evaluate 12 representative methods demonstrating that TSB-UAD is a robust resource for assessing anomaly detection methods. We make our data and code available at www.timeseries.org/TSB-UAD. TSB-UAD provides a valuable, reproducible, and frequently updated resource to establish a leaderboard of univariate time-series anomaly detection methods.

Access control in these systems is often implemented through hybrid vector queries, which combine nearest neighbor search on vector data with relational predicates based on user permissions. However, existing approaches face significant trade-offs: creating dedicated indexes for each user minimizes query latency but introduces excessive storage redundancy, while building a single index and applying access control after vector search reduces storage overhead but suffers from poor recall and increased query latency. This paper introduces HoneyBee, a dynamic partitioning framework that bridges the gap between these approaches by leveraging the structure of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) policies. RBAC, widely adopted in enterprise settings, groups users into roles and assigns permissions to those roles, creating a natural \u0026#34;thin waist\u0026#34; in the permission structure that is ideal for partitioning decisions. Specifically, HoneyBee produces overlapping partitions where vectors can be strategically replicated across different partitions to reduce query latency while controlling storage overhead. By introducing analytical models for the performance and recall of the vector search, HoneyBee formulates the partitioning strategy as a constrained optimization problem to dynamically balance storage, query efficiency, and recall. Evaluations on RBAC workloads demonstrate that HoneyBee reduces storage redundancy compared to role partitioning and achieves up to 6x faster query speeds than row-level security (RLS) with only 1.4x storage increase, offering a practical middle ground for secure and efficient vector search.

This situation can be problematic for two main reasons: On the one hand, this may cause surprising results when two components influence each other in an unexpected way. On the other hand, this can lead to wasted effort in regard to both engineering and research, e.g., when an improvement for one component is dwarfed or entirely canceled out by problems of another component. Therefore, we argue that making improvements to a single optimization component requires a thorough understanding of how these changes might affect the other components. To achieve this understanding, we present results of a comprehensive experimental analysis of the interplay in the traditional optimizer architecture using the widely-used PostgreSQL system as prime representative. Our evaluation and analysis revisit the core building blocks of such an optimizer, i.e. per-column statistics, cardinality estimation, cost model, and plan generation. In particular, we analyze how these building blocks influence each other and how they react when faced with faulty input, such as imprecise cardinality estimates. Based on our results, we draw novel conclusions and make recommendations on how these should be taken into account.

Persistent obstacles continue to hinder usability, such as the need for manual incrementalization, semantic discrepancies across SQL implementations, and the lack of enterprise-grade operational features (e.g. granular access control, disaster recovery). While the rise of incremental view maintenance (IVM) as a way to integrate streaming with databases has been a huge step forward, transaction isolation in the presence of IVM remains underspecified, which leaves the maintenance of application-level invariants as a painful exercise for the user. Meanwhile, most streaming systems optimize for latencies of 100 milliseconds to 3 seconds, whereas many practical use cases are well-served by latencies ranging from seconds to tens of minutes. In this paper, we present delayed view semantics (DVS), a conceptual foundation that bridges the semantic gap between streaming and databases, and introduce Dynamic Tables, Snowflake’s declarative streaming transformation primitive designed to democratize analytical stream processing. DVS formalizes the intuition that stream processing is primarily a technique to eagerly compute derived results asynchronously, while also addressing the need to reason about the resulting system end to end. Dynamic Tables then offer two key advantages: ease of use through DVS, enterprise-grade features, and simplicity; as well as scalable cost efficiency via IVM with an architecture designed for diverse latency requirements. We first develop extensions to transaction isolation that permit the preservation of invariants in streaming applications. We then detail the implementation challenges of Dynamic Tables and our experience operating it at scale. Finally, we share insights into user adoption and discuss our vision for the future of stream processing.\n","date":1752019200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1752019200,"objectID":"b7150549ff16ace11e049aa0a7912cc3","permalink":"https://diprlab.github.io/dbrg/events/2025/summer/01/","publishdate":"2025-06-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/dbrg/events/2025/summer/01/","section":"dbrg","summary":"Streaming Democratized: Ease Across the Latency Spectrum with Delayed View Semantics and Snowflake Dynamic Tables","tags":null,"title":"Summer 2025 Week 1","type":"dbrg"},{"authors":["Orobosa Ekhator"],"categories":null,"content":" Title In-Database Time Series Clustering Authors Yunxiang Su, Kenny Ye Liang, Shaoxu Song Abstract Time series data are often clustered repeatedly across various time ranges to mine frequent subsequence patterns from different periods, which could further support downstream applications. Existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) time series clustering method, such as K-Shape, can proficiently cluster time series data referring to their shapes. However, in-database time series clustering problem has been neglected, especially in IoT scenarios with large-volume data and high efficiency demands. Most time series databases employ LSM-Tree based storage to support intensive writings, yet causing underlying data points out-of-order in timestamps. Therefore, to apply existing out-of-database methods, all data points must be fully loaded into memory and chronologically sorted. Additionally, out-of-database methods must cluster from scratch each time, making them inefficient when handling queries across different time ranges. In this work, we propose an in-database adaptation of SOTA time series clustering method K-Shape. Moreover, to solve the problem that K-Shape cannot efficiently handle long time series, we propose Medoid-Shape, as well as its in-database adaptation for further acceleration.

We investigate the quality of industrial-strength cardinality estimators and find that all estimators routinely produce large errors. We further show that while estimates are essential for finding a good join order, query performance is unsatisfactory if the query engine relies too heavily on these estimates. Using another set of experiments that measure the impact of the cost model, we find that it has much less influence on query performance than the cardinality estimates. Finally, we investigate plan enumeration techniques comparing exhaustive dynamic programming with heuristic algorithms and find that exhaustive enumeration improves performance despite the sub-optimal cardinality estimates.

PDX accelerates exact and approximate similarity search thanks to its dimension-by-dimension search strategy that operates on multiple-vectors-at-a-time in tight loops. It beats SIMD-optimized distance kernels on standard horizontal vector storage (avg 40% faster), only relying on scalar code that gets auto-vectorized. We combined the PDX layout with recent dimension-pruning algorithms ADSampling and BSA that accelerate approximate vector search. We found that these algorithms on the horizontal vector layout can lose to SIMD-optimized linear scans, even if they are SIMD-optimized. However, when used on PDX, their benefit is restored to 2-7x. We find that search on PDX is especially fast if a limited number of dimensions has to be scanned fully, which is what the dimension-pruning approaches do. We finally introduce PDX-BOND, an even more flexible dimension-pruning strategy, with good performance on exact search and reasonable performance on approximate search.

However, many real-world applications jointly query both vector data and structured data, imposing label constraints such as attributes and keywords on the search, known as filtered ANNS. Effectively incorporating filtering conditions with vector similarity presents significant challenges, including index for dynamically filtered search space, agnostic query labels, computational overhead for label-irrelevant vectors, and potential inadequacy in returning results. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a novel approach called the Label Navigating Graph, which encodes the containment relationships of label sets for all vectors. Built upon graph-based ANNS methods, we develop a general framework termed Unified Navigating Graph (UNG) to bridge the gap between label set containment and vector proximity relations. UNG offers several advantages, including versatility in supporting any query label size and specificity, fidelity in exclusively searching filtered vectors, completeness in providing sufficient answers, and adaptability in integration with most graph-based ANNS algorithms. Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms all baselines, achieving 10x speedups at the same accuracy.

Current Database Management Systems (DBMS) struggle to efficiently answer queries while enforcing a large number of Fine-Grained Access Control (FGAC) policies. Sieve is a middleware for relational DBMSs that generate guarded expressions, which are efficient rewriting of queries with a given set of policies. In this paper, we extend Sieve with caching of guarded expressions to better handle dynamic workloads involving a series of policy insertions and queries at different frequencies. Our novel caching approach includes a replacement policy based on clock algorithm and a refresh strategy based on cost analysis to select between regeneration and update of guarded expressions. We also develop a workload generator that creates different workloads with different distributions of policies, and queries that are relevant to a chosen scenario. These workloads simulate realistic IoT scenarios, such as smart campus applications. Experimental results show that Sieve, enhanced with caching, is effective in terms of cache-hits and efficient in terms of system load and latency of query answering, in dynamic environments.\n","date":1718928000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1718928000,"objectID":"28d2022ac8d19b037e9b9a5998b73df1","permalink":"https://diprlab.github.io/post/2024/anadi_rpe/","publishdate":"2024-06-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2024/anadi_rpe/","section":"post","summary":"Anadi Shakya completed her Research Proficiency Examination (RPE) about her work on improving {{% mention \"Sieve\" %}}.","tags":null,"title":"RPE presentation - Anadi Shakya","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Summer Research Academy (SRA) is designed to engage undergraduate students interested in making a difference in their communities by pursuing research opportunities in STEM, biomedical, behavioral, clinical, health, and social sciences.

The lack of fine-grained access controls on many cloud services make actions that violate the expectations of other users likely, resulting in multiuser conflicts. For example, a user with editor permissions may add a user outside the organization and revoke the permissions of another user, all without consent from the original resource owner. These multiuser conflicts may compromise a resource’s confidentiality, integrity, or availability, leading to a lack of trust in cloud services.\nACCORD is a web application built on top of Google Drive which prevents and detects multiuser conflicts. It employs a simulator to help users preemptively identify potential conflicts and assist them in defining action constraints.
