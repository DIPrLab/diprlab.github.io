    &lt;td&gt;
      Social event detection refers to extracting relevant message clusters from social media data streams to represent specific events in the real world. Social event detection is important in numerous areas, such as opinion analysis, social safety, and decision-making. Most current methods are supervised and require access to large amounts of data. These methods need prior knowledge of the events and carry a high risk of leaking sensitive information in the messages, making them less applicable in open-world settings. Therefore, conducting unsupervised detection while fully utilizing the rich information in the messages and protecting data privacy remains a significant challenge. To this end, we propose a novel social event detection framework, ADP-SEMEvent, an unsupervised social event detection method that prioritizes privacy. Specifically, ADP-SEMEvent is divided into two stages, i.e., the construction stage of the private message graph and the clustering stage of the private message graph. In the first stage, an adaptive differential privacy approach is used to construct a private message graph. In this process, our method can adaptively apply differential privacy based on the events occurring each day in an open environment to maximize the use of the privacy budget. In the second stage, to address the reduction in data utility caused by noise, a novel 2-dimensional structural entropy minimization algorithm based on optimal subgraphs is used to detect events in the message graph. The highlight of this process is unsupervised and does not compromise differential privacy. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that ADP-SEMEvent can achieve detection performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining reasonable privacy budget parameters.
    &lt;/td&gt;

    &lt;td&gt;
      The detection of anomalies in time series has gained ample academic and industrial attention. However, no comprehensive benchmark exists to evaluate time-series anomaly detection methods. It is common to use (i) proprietary or synthetic data, often biased to support particular claims; or (ii) a limited collection of publicly available datasets. Consequently, we often observe methods performing exceptionally well in one dataset but surprisingly poorly in another, creating an illusion of progress. To address the issues above, we thoroughly studied over one hundred papers to identify, collect, process, and systematically format datasets proposed in the past decades. We summarize our effort in TSB-UAD, a new benchmark to ease the evaluation of univariate time-series anomaly detection methods. Overall, TSB-UAD contains 13766 time series with labeled anomalies spanning different domains with high variability of anomaly types, ratios, and sizes. TSB-UAD includes 18 previously proposed datasets containing 1980 time series and we contribute two collections of datasets. Specifically, we generate 958 time series using a principled methodology for transforming 126 time-series classification datasets into time series with labeled anomalies. In addition, we present data transformations with which we introduce new anomalies, resulting in 10828 time series with varying complexity for anomaly detection. Finally, we evaluate 12 representative methods demonstrating that TSB-UAD is a robust resource for assessing anomaly detection methods. We make our data and code available at www.timeseries.org/TSB-UAD. TSB-UAD provides a valuable, reproducible, and frequently updated resource to establish a leaderboard of univariate time-series anomaly detection methods.

    &lt;td&gt;
      Time series data are often clustered repeatedly across various time ranges to mine frequent subsequence patterns from different periods, which could further support downstream applications. Existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) time series clustering method, such as K-Shape, can proficiently cluster time series data referring to their shapes. However, in-database time series clustering problem has been neglected, especially in IoT scenarios with large-volume data and high efficiency demands. Most time series databases employ LSM-Tree based storage to support intensive writings, yet causing underlying data points out-of-order in timestamps. Therefore, to apply existing out-of-database methods, all data points must be fully loaded into memory and chronologically sorted. Additionally, out-of-database methods must cluster from scratch each time, making them inefficient when handling queries across different time ranges. In this work, we propose an in-database adaptation of SOTA time series clustering method K-Shape. Moreover, to solve the problem that K-Shape cannot efficiently handle long time series, we propose Medoid-Shape, as well as its in-database adaptation for further acceleration. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the higher efficiency of our proposals, with comparable effectiveness. Remarkably, all proposals have already been implemented in an open-source commodity time series database, Apache IoTDB.
    &lt;/td&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Detecting unwanted or suspicious Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)-based trackers is challenging, due in part to cross-platform compatibility issues, and inconsistent detection methods. BL(u)E CRAB identifies suspicious BLE trackers based on various risk factors including the number of encounters, time with the user, distance traveled with the user, number of areas each device appeared in and device proximity to user. BL(u)E CRAB presents this information in an intuitive way to help users determine which devices pose the biggest threat to them based on their context.&lt;/p&gt;
