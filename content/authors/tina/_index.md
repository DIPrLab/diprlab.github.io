I am a Senior Undergraduate studying Computer Science at Portland State University. 

I am currently working on my Bachelor's thesis for the University's Honors Program. The topic of my thesis is internet privacy in relation to
children. I've been researching internet privacy laws like GDPR and COPPA to see how much websites comply with these laws. I then plan 
to develop my own software that helps further with the protection of children's privacy.
