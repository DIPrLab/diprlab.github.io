I am a Graduate Student at Portland State University in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.pdx.edu/computer-science/). I completed my undergraduate from the [Department of Information Technology](https://www.gitam.edu/gitam-school-technology-visakhapatnam/departments/computer-science-and-engineering) at GITAM University. 

My research interests are developing applications with a strong commitment to incorporating and adhering to privacy policies. Specifically, my research centers on data protection strategies with a specific focus on minimizing the collection of user data across various dimensions within the context of e-commerce applications. The goal is to design and implement robust privacy measures that strike a balance between the functionality of the application and the user's right to control and limit the data shared. My overall research objective is to build e-commerce applications that supports privacy policy.
