I am a graduate student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.pdx.edu/computer-science/) at Portland State University. I completed my undergraduate from the [London Metropoliton University](https://www.londonmet.ac.uk/). With a background in Database Development and upcoming internship as a Cloud Data Warehouse Engineer, I am deeply passionate about leveraging technology to solve complex problems and drive innovation. 

My journey in the field of computer science has been dynamic and rewarding. Alongside my academic pursuits, I have served as a Teaching Assistant, where I've had the privilege of assisting fellow students and professors alike. From guiding students through their queries to collaborating with professors on assignments and quizzes, I am committed to fostering a supportive learning environment where everyone can thrive. 

My experience extends beyond the classroom as well. As a former Project Manager, I honed my organizational and teamwork skills, successfully leading teams to deliver projects in real-world scenarios. This role has instilled in me a proactive mindset and an ability to navigate challenges with resilience and determination. 

Driven by curiosity and a thirst for knowledge, I approach each day as an opportunity to learn and grow. Whether it's exploring new technologies or embracing fresh challenges, I am always eager to expand my horizons and push the boundaries of what's possible. 

I believe in the power of continuous learning, collaboration, and innovation, and I am excited to embark on the next chapter of my journey in the ever-evolving world of technology.
