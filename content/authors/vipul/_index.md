I am a graduate student at Portland State University in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.pdx.edu/computer-science/). I completed my undergraduate from the [Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering](https://sapthagiri.edu.in/ece) at Sapthagiri College of Engineering. 

My research interests are in the intersection of databases and designing data applications. Specifically, my current research focuses on building stable and scalable access control system for different data storage systems. I am also interested in knowledge graphs and its integrations with Large Language Models.
