I am a Ph.D. Student at Portland State University in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.pdx.edu/computer-science/).

My research interest is to delve into the network protocols used to facilitate the commnication of IoT deivces with each other and with edge and cloud services, specifically to strengthen the security and privacy controls employed in that space.
