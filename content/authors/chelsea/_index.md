I am a high schooler at Sunset High School. I completed an internship at the Institute of Computing in Research, and through that internship, I joined the DIPr Lab. Although I have many interests in the sciences, I am also deeply passionate about law and social justice. Because of that, I was brought on a project that combined computer science and social justice (in particular, preventing stalking) named the BL(u)E Crab project, working under Primal Pappachan and Dylan Conklin.
