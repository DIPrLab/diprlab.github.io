I recently finished my B.S. in computer science,
alongside which I also served as a teaching assistant for a number of courses.

I've had an ongoing interest in security and privacy.
I'm particularly interested in exploring their intersections with other areas of 
computer science such as systems, AI, and the cloud.
Previously, I've collaborated on secure network protocols.
I'm passionate about making security and privacy controls usable and accessible--not only creating secure systems, but ensuring their adoption.
