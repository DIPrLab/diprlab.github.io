I am a PhD Student in Computer Science at Portland State University in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.pdx.edu/computer-science/). 

I specialize in the convergence of data management and privacy, with a focus on optimizing database systems. Presently, my research revolves around the seamless integration of caching mechanisms into scalable access control frameworks within database management systems. This endeavor aims to enhance operational efficiency and bolster data security, thereby addressing critical challenges in contemporary data-centric environments.
