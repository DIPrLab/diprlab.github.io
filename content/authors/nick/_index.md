Iâ€™m Nick Morales, and I'm a PhD Student of Computer Science at Portland State University.  Previously I was at Reed College and Oregon State University where I completed my B.S. in Zoology where I was primarily focused on vertebrates, particularly mammals.  I then did an internship with the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife.  I later went to Southern Oregon University where I got my B.S. in Computer Science.

I enjoy researching a variety of subjects in the physcial and digital sciences.  Currently I'm doing research on improving database privacy which may extend to other areas.  Sadly though I feel that privacy met its practical online death sometime around 2011.
