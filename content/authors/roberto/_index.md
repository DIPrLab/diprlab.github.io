I am an Assistant Professor at Portland State University in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.pdx.edu/computer-science/). I completed my Ph.D. from the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.uci.edu/) at University of California, Irvine. 

My research interests are in the intersection of data management and privacy. Specifically, my research focuses on data protection methods such as access control, differential privacy, inference control, and  privacy policies. My overall research objective is to build data management systems that supports fast, scalable, transparent, and private computing.
