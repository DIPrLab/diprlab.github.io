I am a Graduate Student at Portland State University in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.pdx.edu/computer-science/). I completed my B.S. in Computer Science at Portland State University.

My research interests are in the intersection of networking and privacy. Specifically, my research focuses on user protection from unwanted Bluetooth tracking. My research objective is to build privacy-respecting security software that supports fast, convenient, transparent, and private computing.
