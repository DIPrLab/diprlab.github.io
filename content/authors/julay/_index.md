I am a masters student in Computer Science at Portland State University. My undergraduate degree was in Piano Performance 
and Musical Analysis (BA Sarah Lawrence College, 2002). I've spent most of my life immersed in music and literature, but I 
have always felt an affinity toward logic and mathematics as well. I began studying computer science in 2021 and entered the
masters program in 2024.

My degree focus is PL theory and verification, from a security perspective. Special interests include compilers, 
semantics, microarchitecture, cache-based side channel attacks (like Spectre), and protections against same.  

Privacy is so important to me, and as soon as I discovered the existence of DIPR Lab at PSU, I knew I had to get involved. 
This is my first term as a member of the lab, and my current aim is to assist with research on inference control. I am also
taking Professor Primal's Privacy-Informed Computing course, to familiarize myself with the major ideas and computational 
techniques in the field.
