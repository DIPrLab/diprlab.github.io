Welcome to DIPr lab! This is the lab wiki for members of DIPr lab at Portland State University.

The main goal of our research is give users more control over their data, with a particular focus on data stored in databases. We work on problems in the intersection of data management and privacy and leverage query processing and privacy-preserving techniques respectively. You can read more about our projects on [the home page](/).

This lab wiki is a living document and it is intended to provide an overview for the current members and  others about how we do our work, and the expectations of being part of our team. It is also a space to document institutional knowledge and for important information about procedures and available resources. If you have suggestions for additions or changes, please contact [Dr. Primal](mailto:primal@pdx.edu) or make a pull request.

<!-- At DIPr lab, we also aim to build and sustain a community in which everyone feels welcomed, respected, and intellectually stimulated. -->
