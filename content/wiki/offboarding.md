Everyone will eventually move on from the lab—whether it’s to complete a degree, start a job, or pursue new opportunities, which is an exciting time! A clear offboarding process ensures that your work can seamlessly continue, that future collaborators have what they need, and that any remaining steps (e.g., publications, future projects) are clearly outlined.

## Exit Interview

Set up a dedicated time to meet with Primal to talk about your time in the lab, and to go through the below checklist to make sure these have been done. Besides the checklist, things to talk about include the best part of being in our team, whether you got the support you needed and what could we improve for mentoring and training someone in your role in the future. 


## Project Documentation

Project work should be hosted either in a repository under the organizational GitHub account.

Each project should have an easily found README text file that provides information for others so they can navigate and use your work, and give contact information for authors (and any data creators/use restrictions if propietary data). Ideally, the README should also include links to publications and presentations from the work.

## Publications

Science is not finished until it has been communicated. Ideally, you’ll have the chance to publish your results in a conference or journal. In your exit interview, coordinate with Primal on any remaining publications and set a submission timeline. Ensure that all publications and presentations from your projects are archived in the appropriate folder on the lab’s Google Drive and are listed on the lab website where appropriate.


## Equipment

Ensure any lab equipment (e.g. computer and peripherals) you have been using has been returned to the lab, office furniture is present. Make sure any problems with equipment are documented and that Primal and relevant department staff so that they can be addressed.
