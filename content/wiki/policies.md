### Diversity and Inclusivity Policy

At DIPr lab, we also aim to build and sustain a community in which everyone feels welcomed, respected, and intellectually stimulated. It is my intent to ensure that members from diverse backgrounds, including but not limited to race, color, national origin, language, sex, disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, and religion, feel welcome and included in this group. If you notice that any of the interactions in this group are not respectful of this diversity, please bring it to my attention. Any suggestions on how to improve the inclusivity of the lab policies are also much appreciated. If you have experienced or observed any discrimination, please report it and/or reach out to support groups listed on PSU's [Equity and Compliance](https://www.pdx.edu/diversity/equity-compliance) website.


### Reporting

DIPr lab desires to create a safe space for everyone. If you or someone you know has been harassed by a lab member or if you have concerns, please contact Primal. If you do not wish to contact Primal, please contact the Department Chair - [Dr. Mark Jones](mailto:mpj@pdx.edu ) or the Dean of College - [Dr. Joseph Bull](mailto:joseph.bull@pdx.edu). 

Please remember that by way of his position at the university, Primal is a mandated reporter under Title IX. This means that he is not allowed to keep matters falling under Title IX confidential, and is required to disclose these incidents to the administration. You are welcome to discuss matters with Primal, but please keep this in mind when doing so. Primal will do his best to remind you of his responsibilities at the start of conversations anticipated to relate to these topics. 
If you would rather share information about these matters with a PSU staff member who does not have these reporting responsibilities and can keep the information confidential, please use these campus resources:

- Confidential Advocates: 503-894-7982 or schedule online (for matters regarding sexual harassment and sexual and relationship violence)
- Center for Student Health and Counseling: 1880 SW 6th Avenue #200; 503-725-2800

You can also find additional resources on [PSUâ€™s Sexual Misconduct Response website](https://www.pdx.edu/sexual-assault/).

#### Discrimination and Bias Incidents

The Office of Equity and Compliance (OEC) addresses complaints of discrimination, discriminatory Harassment, and sexual harassment against employees (faculty and staff). If you or someone you know believes they have been discriminated against, you may file a complaint. Someone from the OEC will contact you to discuss how to best address your complaint.

The Bias Review Team (BRT) gathers information on bias incidents that happen on and around campus, and gives resources and support to individuals who experience them. You can report a bias incident you experienced or learned about. A member of the BRT will contact you if you indicate you would like to be contacted.


## Confidentiality Policy

All communications within DIPr lab, including emails, discussions, and meetings involving research data or methodologies, should be treated with care and kept confidential. Information should only be shared using secure methods, and with third parties only after obtaining permission from the principal investigator or project leader. Public sharing of research findings should be coordinated with the prinicipal investigator. This policy is intended to ensure the integrity of our work and applies during and after involvement with the research group.

## Privacy Policy

The privacy of all members and collaborators of DIPr lab is respected and protected. Personal information, such as contact details and other identifying data, will be used solely for professional and administrative purposes and will not be shared with third parties without consent. Data collected as part of research will be handled in compliance with ethical standards and legal regulations, ensuring that participant identities are safeguarded, and that personal information remains confidential. Members of the research group are expected to handle any personal data they encounter in a manner that respects the privacy of all individuals involved in the research.
