Welcome to DIPr Lab! We are excited that you have decided to join our team! We hope that these onboarding resources, guidelines, and tips will make the first few   steps easier.


## Set up the first meeting

Check the Primal's Google Calendar ([See someone's calendar availability](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/6294878?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop)) and propose a time to meet that works for both of you. Primal's office is room FAB 115-08.

## Join the GitHub organization

Our group has [a GitHub organization account](https://github.com/DIPrLab) to host public and private repos for the software we create for each of the research projects. You can learn more about how to use [GitHub](https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners) in this tutorial. This is also the location for our group website, which is hosted through GitHub pages.

## Add yourself to the group's website

After you have joined the GitHub organization, you can add yourself as a member to [the lab website](https://github.com/DIPrLab/website) by following the instructions on the README of the website repo.

## Join our Zulip instance

We use Zulip for communication around research projects, general updates, and sharing random news of interest. You can join our Zulip instance by signing up [here](https://dipr.zulip.cs.pdx.edu/join/zmjww3y3maoyyndcop746ppm/).

## Request to be added to the shared drive

We use a shared drive on Google drive to manage common resources that are relevant to all members. You can join this drive by sending an email about the same to [Primal](mailto:primal@pdx.edu).

## Mailing list

Send an invite to the [DIPr lab Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/a/pdx.edu/g/dipr-group) (only visible if you are logged into your PSU email) which is used for broadcasting information that is relevant to all group members.


## Office Space

If you prefer to work in the department, please request for a desk in the first meeting with Primal. Lab members sit either in the DIPr lab space (FAB 135-04), or in the shared graduate student cubicle space. Graduate students are expected to make use of their allocated desk in the DIPr lab space. Group meetings are held in one of the conference rooms.

## Individual Development/Mentoring plans

Within the first few weeks of joining the DIPr Lab, you should work with Primal to develop a plan outlining your short, medium, and long term goals. More on individual developing plans can be found in [Expectations](/expectations).
