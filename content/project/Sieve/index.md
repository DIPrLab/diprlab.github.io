SIEVE is a versatile middleware that enhances access control in DBMS, enabling efficient query processing even with a large number of access control policies. We're currently integrating caching to further improve query performance. Additionally, we've developed a workload generator that simulates various scenarios to test policy models and ensure access control compliance, reflecting real-world conditions.
