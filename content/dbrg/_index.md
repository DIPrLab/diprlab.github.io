The Database Reading Group meets on a weekly basis to discuss papers related (broadly speaking) to database technology. 
 

- **When**: Weekly Fridays, 9:30 AM to 11:00 AM.
- **Where**: Room 130 in PSU's Fourth Avenue Building (For directions, see [Contact](/contact)).
- **Who will present**: Designated group members will lead the discussion each week.
- **Who can attend**: Anyone, inside or outside of PSU, with an interest in the subject matter.

Reading group announcements are sent to [the DBRG mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/pdx.edu/g/database-reading-group). This will include information about the research paper, presenter, and how to access it.
